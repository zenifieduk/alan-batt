# How Increased Home Supply Will Affect Wigan House Prices in 2025

*Published: 12th June 2025 | Reading time: 7 minutes*

---

**Quick takeaway:** Wigan faces unprecedented housing supply increases in 2025, with over 1,000 new homes planned at Mosley Common alone. This will likely moderate the exceptional 6.2% annual price growth currently experienced, transitioning to more sustainable growth rates of 4-5% annually while maintaining overall market stability.

## Market Overview

The relationship between housing supply and price dynamics represents one of the most fundamental aspects of property economics. As Wigan prepares for a significant increase in housing supply throughout 2025 and beyond, the impact on house prices will be shaped by complex interactions between new construction, existing demand patterns, and regional economic factors.

Current market conditions in Wigan demonstrate exceptional performance, with **average house prices reaching £189,000 in April 2025, representing a 6.2% annual increase**. This growth significantly outpaces both the North West regional average of 3.1% and reflects the area's position as one of the strongest performing property markets in the region.

## The Housing Supply Pipeline

### Major Development Projects

Wigan faces an unprecedented expansion in housing supply, driven by several large-scale developments currently in various stages of completion. The **£104 million Mosley Common development scheme will deliver more than 1,000 new homes, including 369 affordable properties**. This development alone represents a substantial increase in the local housing stock, with **planning permission already secured and construction expected to continue through 2025**.

The **Mosley Common masterplan encompasses 1,050 homes across 156 acres, featuring three new parks and transport infrastructure**. This development is part of the broader **Places for Everyone (PfE) Plan, which identifies a requirement for 16,527 new homes in Wigan Borough over the plan period to 2039**.

Additional supply comes from multiple smaller developments, including **14 new affordable homes completed by March 2025 on Scot Lane**, and **38 affordable apartments under construction on Boundary Street**. The cumulative effect of these projects represents a significant increase in housing availability across the borough.

### Strategic Housing Land Assessment

Wigan's housing supply strategy extends beyond individual developments to encompass a comprehensive approach to meeting future demand. The borough has identified **a total housing supply of 18,686 homes over the plan period 2022-2039**, which exceeds the requirement of 16,527 homes and provides **a flexibility allowance to accommodate any non-delivery on sites**.

This housing supply includes **2,554 completions between 2022-2024, 2,199 homes from Places for Everyone Plan allocations, and 4,295 homes from proposed site allocations** in the Wigan Borough Local Plan. The significant pipeline demonstrates the scale of supply increases expected to impact the market.

## Economic Theory and Market Dynamics

### Supply and Demand Fundamentals

The basic economic principle governing housing markets dictates that **when supply exceeds demand, prices tend to decrease, and when demand exceeds supply, prices tend to increase**. However, the housing market's complexity means that price responses to supply changes are rarely immediate or uniform across all property types and locations.

**Housing markets differ significantly from other commodity markets because properties last a long time, are expensive to produce, and their value reflects neighbourhood characteristics including schools, transportation access, and local amenities**. These factors create market imperfections that can delay or moderate price responses to supply changes.

### Regional Supply-Demand Patterns

Current UK housing market trends reveal **a clear link between house price inflation and changes in the number of homes for sale**. Nationally, **supply of homes for sale is up 12% year-on-year, while house price inflation has slowed to 1.4% annually**. This relationship demonstrates how increased supply can moderate price growth even in markets with continued demand.

The North West region shows distinct patterns compared to southern England, where **supply increases of 16-19% have resulted in house prices barely rising by less than 0.5% annually**. In contrast, **northern England regions with modest supply changes maintain above-average price inflation of 2-3%**.

## Impact on Wigan's Property Market

### Short-term Price Effects

The immediate impact of increased housing supply on Wigan's property market will likely manifest through moderated price growth rather than absolute price declines. **Research indicates that properties within a 0.3-mile radius of new developments may experience price falls during or immediately after construction**, but these effects are typically **short-term and tend to blend with wider market property values within 24 months of development completion**.

Given Wigan's **current strong price momentum of 6.2% annual growth**, the introduction of significant new supply will likely **reduce this growth rate toward regional averages** while maintaining overall price stability. The **North West region's forecast growth of 4.5% for 2025** suggests that increased supply may moderate Wigan's exceptional performance to more sustainable levels.

### Market Segment Variations

Different property types and price segments will experience varying impacts from increased supply. **New build properties typically lose over 7% of their value in their first few years** due to depreciation factors. This depreciation effect means that **existing properties may maintain price stability better than new constructions** during periods of increased supply.

The **majority of Wigan sales (30.8%) occur in the £100,000-£150,000 price range**, indicating strong demand for affordable housing. The introduction of **369 affordable properties at Mosley Common** will directly address this market segment and may moderate price growth in the lower-to-middle price ranges.

### Geographic Distribution Effects

Supply increases will not affect all areas of Wigan uniformly. **Properties with significant amenity value that neighbour new developments may see price falls**, while **properties in areas that were in poor condition before development may experience price rises**. This suggests that established residential areas near major developments like Mosley Common may experience temporary price moderation.

The **strategic location of new developments, particularly around improved transport links and the Leigh-Salford-Manchester Busway**, may create new demand centres that redistribute market activity across the borough.

## Demand-Side Factors

### Population and Economic Growth

Despite increased supply, **Wigan's population is forecast to continue growing**, with the broader North West region expecting **population increases that support continued housing demand**. **Manchester alone expects +30,000 residents by 2031**, creating spillover demand for surrounding areas including Wigan.

The **Wigan-Bolton Growth Corridor will accommodate around 1 million sqm of new employment floorspace**, creating job opportunities that may sustain housing demand even as supply increases. This employment growth provides a fundamental demand driver that may offset some supply-induced price pressures.

### Regional Migration Patterns

**Housing supply increases can encourage net migration into an area**, as improved affordability and housing availability attract new residents. Wigan's **relative affordability compared to Manchester and other regional centres** positions it to benefit from this migration effect, potentially maintaining demand levels despite increased supply.

The **strategic transport improvements, including new east-west road infrastructure and enhanced public transport connections**, will improve Wigan's accessibility and attractiveness to commuters working in surrounding employment centres.

## Market Timing and Delivery Constraints

### Construction and Delivery Timelines

The impact of increased supply on prices will be influenced by the **timing and pace of housing delivery**. **Housing construction starts have fallen by 59% nationally from October 2022 to March 2025**, indicating that planned supply increases may face delivery delays.

**Wigan completed 800 homes in the 2023-2024 financial year**, representing a **5% decline from the previous year** in the North West region overall. This suggests that **planned supply increases may be delivered more gradually than initially anticipated**, moderating their immediate price impact.

### Infrastructure and Planning Constraints

**Planning delays remain the greatest constraint on housebuilding** according to industry surveys, potentially slowing the delivery of planned housing supply. The **limited capacity of planning departments** may create bottlenecks that delay supply increases and reduce their short-term price impact.

However, **Wigan Council has granted planning permission for over 22,000 homes since 2011** and maintains a **pro-development stance**, suggesting that local planning processes may be more efficient than national averages.

## Rental Market Implications

### Rental Supply and Demand

Increased housing supply will also affect Wigan's rental market, where **average private rents reached £689 per month in May 2025, representing an 8.0% annual increase**. **Additional rental properties from new developments may moderate rent growth**, particularly in the affordable housing sector where many new units will be designated for affordable rent.

The **substantial increase in rental stock from developments like Mosley Common** may create more choice for tenants and reduce the competitive pressure that has driven recent rent increases. However, **continued population growth and employment expansion may sustain rental demand** despite increased supply.

### Investment Market Response

**Buy-to-let investors may benefit from increased supply** if it moderates purchase prices while rental demand remains strong. The **introduction of new properties with modern amenities and energy efficiency** may create opportunities for investors to achieve competitive rental yields.

**Rental yields in the North West average 6.5%, well above the UK average**, suggesting that the region remains attractive for property investment despite supply increases.

## Long-term Market Outlook

### Sustainable Growth Projections

Long-term forecasts suggest that **increased supply will contribute to more sustainable price growth** rather than dramatic price corrections. **Savills forecasts 28.8% growth for the North West by 2028**, with annual growth rates of **4.5% in 2025, 5.5% in 2026, 6.5% in 2027, and 5.5% in 2028**.

These projections suggest that **increased supply will moderate rather than eliminate price growth**, supporting market stability while maintaining investment attractiveness.

### Infrastructure-Led Development Benefits

The **coordination of housing supply increases with infrastructure improvements** may create positive feedback effects that support property values. **Transport improvements, including the M58 Link Road and enhanced public transport connections**, will improve accessibility and maintain demand for properties in newly developed areas.

**Investment in green spaces, educational facilities, and community infrastructure** as part of major developments like Mosley Common may create amenity value that offsets some negative supply effects on nearby existing properties.

## Policy and Regulatory Considerations

### Affordable Housing Requirements

**Policy-compliant affordable housing provision** in new developments will address specific market segments without directly competing with existing market-rate properties. This segmentation may **reduce the price impact on existing homeowners** while improving housing accessibility for first-time buyers and lower-income households.

The **369 affordable properties at Mosley Common represent 35% of the total development**, demonstrating substantial affordable housing provision that may moderate price pressures in the entry-level market segment.

### Planning and Development Standards

**New developments must meet modern building standards and infrastructure requirements**, potentially creating quality differentials that support existing property values. **Older properties with unique character or established neighbourhood amenities** may maintain price premiums despite increased supply of new homes.

## Market Adaptation Strategies

### Developer Response to Market Conditions

**Property developers will adjust their construction and sales strategies** based on market absorption rates and price trends. **If new supply creates downward price pressure, developers may slow construction phases** or offer incentives to maintain sales momentum.

The **phased delivery approach at major developments like Mosley Common** allows developers to respond to market conditions and adjust supply timing based on demand levels.

### Existing Homeowner Considerations

**Existing homeowners near new developments** should prepare for potential short-term price volatility while recognising that infrastructure improvements and community development typically support long-term value appreciation.

**Properties with unique features, established gardens, or superior locations** may maintain value premiums despite increased supply of new homes.

## Conclusion

The increased home supply in Wigan during 2025 will likely **moderate the exceptional 6.2% annual price growth** currently experienced rather than causing significant price declines. **Economic fundamentals including population growth, employment expansion, and infrastructure investment** provide demand support that should prevent dramatic price corrections.

The **scale of planned supply increases, particularly the 1,000+ homes at Mosley Common**, represents a significant market shift that will **increase buyer choice and reduce competitive pressure**. However, **delivery constraints, phased construction timelines, and continued regional demand growth** will moderate the immediate impact on house prices.

**Regional trends suggest that northern England markets maintain price resilience** despite supply increases, particularly compared to southern England where larger supply increases have created more significant price moderation. **Wigan's strategic location, affordability advantages, and infrastructure investments** position the market to adapt successfully to increased supply while maintaining long-term growth potential.

**Property investors and homeowners should expect a transition to more balanced market conditions** with sustainable price growth rates of 4-5% annually rather than the exceptional recent performance. This transition will create a **healthier market dynamic** with improved affordability and choice for buyers while maintaining property values for existing owners over the medium to long term.

## What This Means for You

**Buyers** should consider that increased supply will likely provide more choice and potentially moderate the competitive pressure that has driven recent price growth. The next 12-18 months may offer better opportunities to find suitable properties without the intense bidding wars seen in recent years.

**Sellers** with plans to move should consider the timing carefully. While prices are unlikely to fall dramatically, the rapid growth rates of recent years may moderate. Properties with unique features or in prime locations will likely maintain value premiums despite increased supply.

**Investors** should note that the rental market may offer opportunities as new supply moderates purchase prices while employment growth sustains rental demand. The combination of infrastructure investment and population growth suggests sustainable long-term prospects despite short-term supply increases.
