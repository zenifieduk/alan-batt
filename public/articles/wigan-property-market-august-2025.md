## Market Activity: A Measured Cooldown

The Wigan property market in August 2025 tells a story of resilience and adaptation. While activity has softened compared to the bustling pace of 2024, pricing strength – particularly for new listings – continues to underpin market confidence.

August saw **1,912 properties** available for sale across Wigan, representing a 7.6% decrease from the same period last year and a 4.3% drop from July. However, this shouldn't cause concern – stock levels remain a healthy **15.8% above the six-year average**, meaning buyers continue to enjoy greater choice than in recent years.

### New Listings Show Moderation

New listings tell a similar story of moderation. At **448 new properties** entering the market, this represents a 12.3% decrease year-on-year and a 12.5% drop from July's figures. Yet we're still operating **4.9% above historical averages**, suggesting the market remains active despite the seasonal adjustment.

### Demand Remains Robust

On the demand side, **437 sales were agreed** in August – down 4.4% on last year and 5.2% below July's activity. The encouraging news? This figure sits **5.8% above our six-year average**, demonstrating that while the market has cooled from its 2024 peak, underlying demand remains robust.

## Pricing: The Standout Story of 2025

Where Wigan's market truly shines is in its pricing resilience. New listings entered the market at an average asking price of **£261,661** – a remarkable **17.2% increase** from August 2024 and 11.1% higher than July alone.

### Size-Adjusted Pricing Shows Strong Growth

The size-adjusted figures are equally impressive, with new listings averaging **£243 per square foot**, representing a **13.6% annual increase** and 4.7% month-on-month growth. This reflects both seller confidence and a premium shift in the types of properties entering our market.

### Completed Sales Maintain Steady Growth

For completed sales, pricing has been more measured but still positive. Properties with agreed sales averaged **£224,579** in asking price – a modest but meaningful **1.9% increase** year-on-year and 2.9% above July. At **£223 per square foot**, agreed sales show 5.2% annual growth, though they dipped slightly (-1.3%) from July, indicating that while sellers remain ambitious, skilled negotiation still plays a role.

## Market Dynamics: Signs of Stabilisation

The market's cooling trend extends to its behavioural indicators. Price changes dropped 14.1% compared to last August and fell 19.8% from July, though they remain **10.1% above long-term averages**. This suggests fewer properties are entering the market with unrealistic expectations.

### Fewer Withdrawals Signal Market Maturity

Encouragingly, withdrawn listings decreased by **11.7% year-on-year** and dramatically by **27.3% month-on-month**. This indicates greater pricing realism among sellers and fewer abandoned sales attempts.

Fall-throughs – while remaining 10.3% above historical averages – showed marginal improvement, down 3.3% annually and 1.7% from July, suggesting slightly more stable transaction conditions.

## What This Means for You

### For Sellers

The data presents a mixed but largely positive picture. While fewer properties are coming to market and activity has moderated, those who do sell are achieving strong prices – particularly premium properties. **The key to success lies in realistic pricing from the outset**, as the market has less tolerance for over-ambitious initial pricing than in previous years.

**Key considerations for sellers:**
- Quality properties continue to command premium prices
- Initial pricing accuracy is more critical than ever
- Market conditions favour well-presented homes
- Transaction success rates are improving with realistic expectations

### For Buyers

August's figures suggest a window of opportunity. With more choice available than historical norms and slightly less competition for properties, there's scope for negotiation. However, the continued strength in pricing – especially for quality homes – means **acting decisively when you find the right property remains important**.

**Key considerations for buyers:**
- Greater property choice than recent historical averages
- Opportunity for negotiation in current market conditions
- Quality properties still achieve strong prices
- Less competition compared to 2024 peak activity levels

## Looking Ahead

Wigan's property market in August 2025 demonstrates remarkable resilience. While the frenetic pace of 2024 has given way to more measured activity, **the fundamentals remain strong**. Prices continue their upward trajectory, stock levels provide healthy choice, and transaction success rates are improving.

For those considering their next move in the Wigan property market, the current conditions offer a more balanced environment – one where quality properties still command premium prices, but where both buyers and sellers can approach transactions with greater confidence and less pressure.
