## Executive Summary

The Wigan property market in August 2025 reflects a cooling trend in activity but continued strength in pricing, particularly for new listings. Stock levels remain high compared with historical averages, but both supply and demand softened compared with last year and July. This comprehensive update explores the latest market trends, August performance metrics, and strategic insights for the autumn market ahead.

## August 2025 Market Performance Overview

The Wigan property market in August 2025 reflects a cooling trend in activity but continued strength in pricing, particularly for new listings. Stock levels remain high compared with historical averages, but both supply and demand softened compared with last year and July.

### Supply and Demand

There were **1,912 properties for sale** in August, down 7.6% year-on-year and slightly lower than July. Even so, stock levels remain 16% above the six-year average, giving buyers more choice than in past years.

New listings fell to **448 in August**, 12% down on last year and 13% below July – but still slightly above the six-year average. This suggests fewer homeowners are coming to market, perhaps waiting for greater stability in demand after a busier first half of the year.

On the demand side, **437 sales were agreed** in August, 4% fewer than last year and 5% below July. Still, activity was 6% above the long-term average, showing that while demand has eased, it remains stronger than historical norms.

### Pricing Trends

Pricing continues to be one of Wigan's standout features in 2025. New listings came to market at an average asking price of **£261,661**, up 17% compared with last year and 11% higher than July. On a size-adjusted basis, new listings averaged **£243 per sq ft**, 14% higher than last year and up nearly 5% month-on-month.

This reflects ongoing confidence among sellers and a higher share of premium homes entering the market.

For properties where sales were agreed, pricing was steadier. The average agreed asking price was **£224,579**, a modest 1.9% rise on last year and 2.9% above July. On a £ per sq ft basis, agreed deals averaged **£223**, up 5% annually but down slightly (-1.3%) from July.

This suggests that while sellers are ambitious, buyers are still able to negotiate, especially in the face of broader affordability pressures.

### Market Behaviour

Market churn indicators show a noticeable cooling compared with last summer. Price changes fell 14% year-on-year and 20% month-on-month, though they remain 10% above the long-term average. This reflects fewer over-optimistic listings needing adjustment.

Withdrawn listings dropped 12% compared with last year and 27% compared with July, signalling that fewer sellers are giving up on their sales. Fall-throughs also improved slightly, down 3% year-on-year and 2% month-on-month, though they remain 10% higher than the long-term average, hinting at ongoing fragility in transactions.

## Outlook

Wigan's market in August 2025 is characterised by softer activity but firm prices. While fewer homes are coming to market and fewer sales are being agreed than last year, both new listing and agreed sale prices remain resilient, especially on a per-square-foot basis.

For sellers, this means there is still appetite, but realistic pricing is essential to secure a sale in a market where buyers have more choice. For buyers, the moderation in demand provides scope for negotiation, though premium homes continue to command strong values.

**Key August Takeaways:**
1. **Pricing Strength:** New listings at £261,661 (up 17% year-on-year)
2. **Market Activity:** 437 sales agreed (down 4% year-on-year)
3. **Stock Levels:** 1,912 properties for sale (16% above six-year average)
4. **Negotiation Scope:** Buyers have more choice and negotiating power
5. **Premium Performance:** Higher-end properties maintaining strong values

**Strategic Implications:**
- Sellers should price realistically to secure sales
- Buyers have increased negotiating power
- Premium properties continue to perform well
- Market cooling provides opportunities for strategic purchases

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor pricing trends carefully
- Take advantage of increased stock levels
- Focus on realistic pricing strategies
- Prepare for potential autumn market changes

The Wigan property market shows resilience in pricing despite cooling activity, creating a balanced environment for both buyers and sellers in August 2025.
